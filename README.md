**<h1 align = center >BlackJack</h1>**
### BlackJack is a very popular card game. At the start of the game, the player and dealer receive 2 cards each. The players cards are dealt face up while the dealer has one face down. The objective of the game is score higher than the dealer but not over 21.
The home screen welcomes the players to the game. The deal button randomly shuffles 52 cards and places 2 for the dealer and player. The player gets the option to hit and add more cards if heâ€™s comfortable. The stand button allows the player to skip a card. Then the computer compares the total sum for both the dealer and the player, after which the dealer can still take more cards if he wants. The player does not get any more opportunity to add cards once he hits the stand button.
